(flat_quadtree.dll) plaid.dll
-----------------------------

flat_quadtree.dll uses a quad-tree built on the implicit structure of
IEEE754 floating-point numbers, as well as fully contiguous storage
for all points.

The quadtree has a fixed structure, with 16 levels.  A given zone in
the quadtree is specified by a 32-bit bitstring designating the
direction choices made at each level (2 bits per level) and a 32-bit
mask.  Given this representation of a zone, it's a constant-time
operation to get the bounding rectangle for the zone: the x-choices
are treated as the leading 16 bits of the x edges, and likewise for
the y-choices.

To Build
--------

On a Windows mingw-64/msys installation, the following sequence of
commands will produce plaid.dll as it has been submitted:

$ make clean
$ CXXFLAGS="-O3 -mavx -march=native -fvisibility=internal -DZONE_BUCKET_CAP=15000" make
$ cp flat_quadtree.strip.dll plaid.dll
