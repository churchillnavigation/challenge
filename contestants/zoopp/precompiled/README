In here you will find 3 dlls:
    * cygwin1.dll      - cygwin dependency
    * zoopp_hasopt.dll - project compiled with intel haswell optimizations
    * zoopp_genopt.dll - project compiled with generic optimizations

If you compile the project on the target PC you'll get more or less the same optimizations that
zoopp_hasopt.dll has, I think.
