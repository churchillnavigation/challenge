To compile the project you need to install cygwin https://www.cygwin.com/. To be more precise,
the things that are needed from cygwin are:

    * base system
    * gcc-g++ (tested with version 4.9.2-1)
    * make

Once installed open a cygwin terminal, cd to this folder and run 'make'. The result will be put
inside the build folder.

Since we compile with cygwin we have to deal with a dll dependency: 'cygwin1.dll'. For convenience
it is packed inside the project and copied to the build output directory.

You can find this dll under $CYGWIN_HOME/bin.
