All work is my own (other than the point_search.h header file
provided by Churchill) and is hereby released to the public domain.

Hall_1.dll is a single-threaded, binned quadtree approach that beats
the reference implementation by 5-10x on my laptop.  It is my initial
implementation--I intend to multithread it and further optimize it
but wanted to see where it falls on the scoreboard in its current state.

Built with Visual C++ 2013 (project files included).
