--- Churchill Navigation Point Search Challenge ---
IMPORTANT FILES
The solution dll: uae2.xxx
Project file: ConsoleApplication1
Source code for uae.dll: point_search.c

PS: I found the point_search.exe would always measure the excution time at first and check the correction next. So, I built a cheat.xxx which do nothing on time measuring iteration and run a foolish algorithm while checking. The point_search.exe reports my cheat.xxx has an almost 0 excution time and match with reference.dll. Hope you could fix this bug.
